Hi, my name is Sid. I&rsquo;m a developer with a passion for learning and writing. Welcome to my blog!
I started my journey as a software developer in 2018 and have since expanded into software delivery and cloud infrastructure management. During that time I&rsquo;ve collaborated with customers during application implementation phases and worked with technical teams to solve system integration challenges. These days I focus on infrastructure management and developer productivity while managing software deployment on private cloud and on-prem cloud environments. Wearing multiple hats in a small-to-medium scale business is where I get my fix for solving problems."><meta name=keywords content="blog,developer,devops,personal,backend,systems"><meta name=twitter:card content="summary"><meta name=twitter:title content="About me"><meta name=twitter:description content="The Terminal Tinkerer is a blog site that publishes guides and technical deep dives on cloud infrastructure, container orchestration, and modern software development/delivery practices.
